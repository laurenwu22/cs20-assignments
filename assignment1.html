            This is a picture I took on a trip over winter break to Sebastopol,
            CA. It is my favorite place because it reminds me of spending time 
            with my best friend Kelly and not having anything urgent to do 
            except to go outside and eat food downtown.

            One thing that no one would expect about me is that I wrote a
            cookbook in fourth grade that was featured in Time magazine.
